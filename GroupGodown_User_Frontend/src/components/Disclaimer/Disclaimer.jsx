        <h1>WhatsApp Group Disclaimer - Group Godown</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Group Godown (<a href="https://www.groupgodown.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.groupgodown.com</a>), your platform for discovering WhatsApp groups. This WhatsApp group disclaimer outlines important information about the groups listed on our site. All WhatsApp groups submitted on this website are provided by our visitors. Once a group submission policy is followed and a link is submitted, it is published immediately. Please note that no group is owned by Group Godown, and we have no control over their content.
        </p>
        <h2>User Responsibility in WhatsApp Groups</h2>
        <p>
          Group Godown does not verify or take responsibility for the content liability notice within these user submitted groups. Due to the large number of groups, it’s not possible for us to check each one. While we strive to maintain mostly active links, 100% activation isn’t guaranteed due to external factors like group closures. Joining any WhatsApp group is your responsibility, and you should do so at your own risk. Always review the WhatsApp community rules and group guidelines provided by the admin before or immediately after joining.
        </p>
        <h2>Group Submission Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Under our group submission policy, visitors submit links, and we cannot ensure the accuracy or legality of the content. Group Godown is not liable for any privacy issues, offensive material, or legal disputes arising in these groups. If you encounter problems, contact the group admin directly. We also advise protecting your personal data and adhering to local laws when participating.
        </p>
        <h2>Terms and Conditions for WhatsApp Groups</h2>
        <p>
          Deciding which groups to join is entirely up to you. Familiarize yourself with each group’s terms and conditions to ensure your behavior aligns with their rules. For technical issues or to report inactive links, reach out to our support team at <a href="mailto:support@groupgodown.com">support@groupgodown.com</a>. By using this site, you agree to our terms and this WhatsApp group disclaimer for websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join WhatsApp groups responsibly and explore safely on Group Godown!
